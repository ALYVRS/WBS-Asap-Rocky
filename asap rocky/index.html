<h3 class="text4">3 FACTS ABOUT HIM</h3>
<ol><strong class="text7">1. Virgil Abloh was one of his earliest supporters:</strong>
    Virgil Abloh, known for his cultural influence, recognized A$AP Rocky and his crew early on, even before they made a mark in the fashion world. Rocky shared a memorable moment in his speech at the Fashion Show & Style Awards, recalling how Abloh identified them as "those Harlem kids, the trendy ones." Surprised by the recognition, Rocky later enlisted Abloh to creatively direct his debut album and tour.

 <ol><strong class="text8">2. A$AP Rocky thinks celebrities ruined fashion: </strong>If there's one thing that Rocky hates, it's a poseur. Especially when it comes to fashion. In an interview with Fast Company, the rapper states, "Celebrities ruined fashion for me. I used to put a lot of thought into what I was wearing and then...all my favorite brands were being bought and worn by the biggest poseurs and celebrities with terrible taste." Well over the hype, Rocky goes on to say that he's "over it," and he's "just not into the whole name brand thing so much."
